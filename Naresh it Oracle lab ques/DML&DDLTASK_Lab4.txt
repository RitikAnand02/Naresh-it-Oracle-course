***Difference between delete and truncate:-(V.I.M.P)
 * ======================================
  Whenever we are using delete from tablename or truncate table 
tablename then all rows will be deleted from table. Whenever we are
using delete from tablename then all rows are deleted from table and
also those deleted rows are internally stored in a buffer.

 We can get the deleted rows back from the buffer into table by using 
rollback. 

Whenever we are using truncate table tablename then all rows are
permanently deleted from a table. Because truncate is an DDL command.
Thatâ€Ÿs why we cannot get it back this data using rollback.
