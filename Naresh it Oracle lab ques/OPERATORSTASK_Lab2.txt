                                 OPERATORS TASK
                               ==================

Logical operators
-----------------
.In all relational databases if you want to define more than one 
     condition in where clause then we must use either 
            AND or by using OR operators.

AND:-AND operator displays the record if both first condition & 
====  second contion are true.

OR:-OR operator is used to displays a record if either first 
===   condition or second condition is true.



eg:-Online shopping(searching for the products)

--->Create a table laptops with sno,cname,price and mfd

     SNO       CNAME              PRICE          MFD
  --------- ----------        ----------      ---------
       1       HP                68000        24-DEC-23
       2      DELL               50000        12-AUG-24
       3     LENOVO              40000        12-JAN-23
       4       HP                44000        08-APR-22

1.Write a query to display laptop detailes whose cname is HP and
  price is more than 50000?

--->Create a student1 table and insert the records as below.

   sno      sname      sub1         sub2        sub3 
  -----    -------    ------       ------      ------  
    1      gowtham      72          18          24
    2       kiran       60          50          45
    3       raju        12          30          25
    4       subbu       80          88          74


2.by using above student table display the passed student records?

---> total marks  :100
---> pass mark is :35
---> pass means student got 35 marks in all 3 subjects.
---> fail means student got below 35 marks in any subject.

3.by using above student table display the failed student records?
  

4.Write a query to display the employees whose clerks are getting
   more than 1000 salary from emp table?

5.Write a query to display the employees whose clerks are belongs 
  to 20th department?

Note:- In databases if we want to retrive multiple values within a 
====     single column then we must use OR operator. 


6.Write a query to display the all managers and clerks
  from emp table?

7.Write a query to display the employees whose are belongs to 
         20,30,50,70,90 departments from emp table 
                 by using OR operator?


8.Write a query to display the emp record whose sal 
   between 2450 and 3000 from emp table?
            |
 range of values are there go with AND


9.Write a query to display the emp records whose joined in
  1981 from emp table?



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special operators
=================
1)In operator 
-------------

1.In:- It is used to pick the values one by one
=====        from list of values. 
                  or 
it is used to compare column value with list of values.
 

   we can also use in operator in place of OR operator.
when we are retriving multiple values from the same column.
in this case In operator performance is very high compared 
to OR operator.
 
.it avoids writing multi equality condition using OR operator.


1.Write a query to display the employees whose are belongs to
  20,30,50,70,90 from emp table by using in operator.

2.Write a query to display the employee records whose names
  are SMITH,JONES,KING from emp table?

3.Write a query to display the employee records whose empnos
  are 7902,7788,7900 from emp table?

4.Write a query to display the employee records whose sal 
  is 1250,3000,5000 from emp table?

5.Write a query to display the employee records except 
  MANAGERS and CLERKS from emp table?

6.Write a query to display the employees who are belongs to other
  than 10,20 from emp table?

7.SQL>select * from emp
      where deptno not in(10,20,null);

o/p:no rows selected


why not in operator does not work with null?
============================================
.not in operator internally uses iogical AND.

Note:- Whenever we are using IN operator then internally database 
====   servers uses logical OR.whenever we are using NOT IN operator
       then database server internally useslogical AND that's why 
       NOT IN does not work with null values. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)Between And operator
------------------------
2)Between:-This operator is used to retrive range of values from a
========== table column.This operator is also called as Betweenâ€¦.. And
           operator.

.it is used to compare column values with range of values.

.in oracle Between operator work with number,date data type columns.
 


1.Write a query to display the employees who are getting salary 
         between 2000 to 5000 from emp table 
              by using Between operator? 

2.Write a query to display the employees who are getting salary 
        not between 2000 - 5000 from emp table
              by using Between operator?
 
3.Write a query to display the employee records who joined 
  in 1982 from emp table?

4.Write a query to display the employee records except joined 
  in 1981 from emp table?

5 What is the o/p of the following
  select ename,sal from emp where sal Between 5000 and 2000;
  A.displays between 2000 & 5000 salaries
  B.Error
  C.No rows selected
  D.None
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3)is null and is not null
  -----------------------
   These two operators used in where clause only.These two 
operators are used to test weather a column having null 
values or not.

.for null comparision we must use is null operator.dont use = operator


1.Write a query to display the employees who are not getting 
  commission from emp table? 

2.Write a query to display the employees who are getting commission
   from emp table? 

3.Write a query to display the employee record who are not having 
  the manager from emp table?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NVL(),NVL2() functons
--------------------

1.Write a query to display ename, sal, comm, sal+comm of the
   employees from emp table?

2.Update the employee commission with in emp table by using nvl2()
  based on following conditions?

1.if comm-->null then update
     comm-->500

2.if comm-->not null then update
     comm-->comm+500
